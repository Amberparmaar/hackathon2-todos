# Evolution of Todo - Hackathon II Constitution

This constitution serves as the foundational document for the "Evolution of Todo" project in Hackathon II organized by Panaversity. It defines the non-negotiable principles, constraints, workflow, and complete requirements to ensure strict adherence to Spec-Driven Development (SDD). All AI agents (especially Claude Code) and human implementations must follow this constitution without exception.

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (MANDATORY)

Every feature, component, and deployment must begin with a written specification. Follow the strict workflow: Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement. No implementation occurs without a complete specification. Specifications are living documents refined iteratively until the output is correct.

**Rationale**: Ensures clear requirements, prevents scope creep, provides traceability, and enables reliable generation by AI agents.

### II. Zero Manual Coding

Code can only be generated by Claude Code. Refine specs iteratively until output is correct. No manual edits to generated code are permitted. If code is incorrect, the specification must be updated and regenerated.

**Rationale**: Ensures consistency, enables reproducibility, maintains spec-code alignment, and prevents drift between documentation and implementation.

### III. Phase-by-Phase Progression

Each phase builds on the previous one. Phases cannot be skipped. The project evolves through 5 sequential phases from simple console app to fully cloud-native, event-driven, AI-powered distributed system. Each phase must be fully completed and validated before progressing.

**Rationale**: Guarantees learning progression, validates each architectural approach, and ensures complexity is introduced incrementally with proper foundation.

### IV. Reusable Intelligence Priority

Use agent skills, subagents, and reusable blueprints wherever possible (especially for bonus points). Prioritize creating reusable patterns over one-off solutions. Document and encapsulate intelligence for reuse across phases.

**Rationale**: Maximizes efficiency, builds organizational knowledge, accelerates future development, and demonstrates advanced agent capabilities.

### V. Strict Tech Stack Compliance

Only use technologies explicitly allowed in each phase. No alternative frameworks, libraries, or tools without explicit specification update. Phase I: Pure Python. Phase II: Next.js + FastAPI + Neon + Better Auth (JWT). Phase III: OpenAI ChatKit + Agents SDK + Official MCP SDK. Phase IV: Docker + Minikube + Helm + kubectl-ai/kagent. Phase V: Dapr + Kafka/Redpanda + Cloud K8s.

**Rationale**: Ensures consistency, matches hackathon requirements, validates specific technology choices, and prevents scope creep.

### VI. Security & Best Practices

- User isolation via authentication (from Phase II)
- Stateless server design (Phases III–V)
- Graceful error handling
- Clean code (PEP8, TypeScript standards, Tailwind conventions)

**Rationale**: Security and quality are non-negotiable for production-grade systems. Clean code ensures maintainability and reliability.

### VII. Monorepo with Phase Isolation

Each phase has its own isolated folder and specs to prevent cross-contamination while allowing progressive evolution. The project structure must follow the recommended monorepo layout with clear phase boundaries.

**Rationale**: Prevents phase interdependencies, enables independent phase validation, and provides clear separation of concerns.

### VIII. Documentation Excellence

Every phase must include comprehensive README, CLAUDE.md, and spec history. All changes must be documented. Code comments must link to Task IDs and spec sections.

**Rationale**: Ensures knowledge transfer, enables maintenance, provides traceability, and supports evaluation.

## Complete Project Requirements

### Basic Features (Required in All Phases)

- Add Task (title + optional description)
- Delete Task
- Update Task
- View Task List
- Mark as Complete / Incomplete

### Intermediate Features (Required in Phase V)

- Priorities (high/medium/low)
- Tags/Categories (e.g., work, home)
- Search by keyword
- Filter by status, priority, date
- Sort by due date, priority, title

### Advanced Features (Required in Phase V)

- Recurring Tasks (e.g., weekly, daily)
- Due Dates & Time Reminders (with scheduling and notifications)

### AI Integration (Phases III–V)

Natural language interface to manage all tasks. Example commands: "Add a task to buy milk tomorrow", "Show pending tasks", "Mark task 3 as done"

**Rationale**: Demonstrates advanced agent capabilities, provides intuitive UX, and leverages LLMs for natural interaction.

### Bonus Features (Optional but High Points)

- Reusable Intelligence via subagents & skills (+200)
- Cloud-Native Blueprints via Agent Skills (+200)
- Urdu language support in chatbot (+100)
- Voice input/commands (+200)

## Spec-Driven Workflow Per Phase

Each phase follows this isolated cycle within its own `/specs` folder:

### 1. Specify (specify.md)

Write user stories, acceptance criteria, required features, constraints. Define the WHAT clearly and completely before moving to planning.

### 2. Plan (plan.md)

Define architecture, components, APIs, database schema, flow diagrams. Define the HOW with technical details and design decisions.

### 3. Tasks (tasks.md)

Break plan into atomic, testable tasks with unique IDs (e.g., T-001, T-002). Each task links back to sections in specify.md and plan.md. Tasks must be actionable and independently completable.

### 4. Implement (implement.md)

Use Claude Code to generate code based on tasks. Record iterations and final task references in code comments.

**Rule**: No code generation without a referenced Task ID.

## Agent Instructions (for Claude Code & All AI Agents)

### Primary Rules

- Always read this constitution first before any action
- Reference specs using full paths: e.g., @phase3/specs/specify.md
- Never improvise missing requirements — request spec updates
- Code must include comments linking to Task IDs and spec sections
- Prioritize bonus features when specs allow

### Tech Stack Enforcement

- **Phase I**: Pure Python
- **Phase II**: Next.js + FastAPI + Neon + Better Auth (JWT)
- **Phase III**: OpenAI ChatKit + Agents SDK + Official MCP SDK
- **Phase IV**: Docker + Minikube + Helm + kubectl-ai/kagent
- **Phase V**: Dapr + Kafka/Redpanda + Cloud K8s

### Workflow Enforcement

- Follow Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement strictly
- No code without Task ID reference
- No manual edits to generated code
- Validate phase completion before progression
- Document all decisions and iterations

## Governance

### Constitution Supremacy

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All AI agents and human implementations MUST comply with these principles without exception. Any deviation MUST be explicitly justified with rationale and recorded in this document.

### Amendment Process

Amendments require:
1. Proposal with rationale and impact analysis
2. Hackathon organizer approval (for major changes)
3. Explicit documentation in this file
4. Version bump per semantic versioning rules:
   - MAJOR: Backward-incompatible principle removals or redefinitions
   - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance
   - PATCH: Clarifications, wording fixes, non-semantic refinements

### Versioning Policy

Constitution version follows semantic versioning. The version line in this file MUST be updated on every amendment. All amendments MUST be documented with rationale.

### Compliance Review

All generated code and specifications MUST be reviewed for constitution compliance before acceptance. Non-compliant output MUST be regenerated with updated specifications.

### Enforcement

- AI agents MUST validate specs against constitution before generation
- Specifications MUST reference constitution principles explicitly
- Code reviews MUST verify constitution compliance
- Phase progression MUST validate all constitution requirements
